# MachineHole-Scavenger
## About
MachineHole-Scavenger is a cutting-edge mechatronic system designed to efficiently clean manhole sewage waste by utilizing a combination of advanced sensors and actuators.

## Motivation
The primary goal of this project is to eliminate the need for manual scavengers to enter hazardous manholes for waste cleaning purposes. By implementing a robotic solution, the project aims to ensure the safety and well-being of workers while improving the overall efficiency of the cleaning process.

## Robotics
The project incorporates a range of actuators and sensors, including encoders, moisture sensors, and gas sensors. These components enable the system to monitor both the environment and the robot itself, providing a high level of flexibility in manipulating the surroundings. Through the use of kinematics and dynamic modeling, users can control the complex mechatronic system with ease, utilizing a simple button and joystick configuration.

## Mechanical Aspect
The system incorporates various mechanisms that work synchronously to achieve optimal performance. The independent jack controls the X and Y directional motion, while a leadscrew-powered prismatic joint enables precise z-axis actuation. Additionally, a separate actuator is responsible for rotating the mechanism, and the opening and closing of the clamshell are achieved using leadscrew prismatic actuation. These mechanical components ensure efficient and effective operation of the MachineHole-Scavenger.
